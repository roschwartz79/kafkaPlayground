# Kafka Playground!

I'll be learning and experimenting with everything Kafka in this repo! Kafka is so useful to exchange messages, data, and so much more.
Might as well get good at it since it's cool too!

## Contents
- Barebones Spring Kafka: Just using the Spring Kafka API, no other Spring and Spring Boot
- Java Kafka Client Playground: Learning and Experimenting with the official Kafka Java Client
- Spring Kafka Playground: Learning and Experimenting with the Spring-Kafka Libraries
- Micronaut Kafka: Exploring using Kafka with Micronaut... I'm impressed!
- Kafka Command Line: Useful scripts and commands for interacting with Kafka

A docker-compose file is included with each package that needs it in order to quickly setup and teardown
instances of Kafka and Zookeeper for learning and development. 

### Note:
You may need to import each of the sub projects for conveinence in IntelliJ.
